# Security Research Explorations üîç

A collection of experimental security tools and proof-of-concepts developed during security research. These tools are designed for educational purposes and defensive security analysis.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: All tools in this repository are experimental and may be unstable. They are shared for research and educational purposes. Use at your own risk.

## Tools

### üõ°Ô∏è DevSec Audit
**Path**: `tools/devsec-audit/`

A comprehensive security scanner for development environments, inspired by Lynis. Scans projects for security misconfigurations across Git, Docker, VS Code, exposed secrets, and smart contract development (Foundry).

- Multi-module security scanning (Git, Docker, VS Code, Secrets, Foundry)
- Configurable exclusions to reduce false positives  
- Multiple output formats (text, JSON, HTML)
- CI/CD integration support
- Lockfile tampering detection

**Quick Start**:
```bash
cd tools/devsec-audit
just run --target /path/to/project
```

### üîå VSCode Extension Inspector  
**Path**: `tools/vscode-extension-inspector/`

A Python tool for monitoring and analyzing VSCode marketplace extensions. Helps identify potentially malicious extensions through metadata analysis, download patterns, and publisher verification.

- Search extensions by keywords, tags, and dates
- Suspicious pattern detection (unverified publishers, low downloads, etc.)
- Download extensions for deeper analysis
- Continuous monitoring with Discord alerts
- Publisher verification checks

**Quick Start**:
```bash
cd tools/vscode-extension-inspector
python VSExInspector.py --keywords "solidity,ethereum" --analyze
```

### üéØ Test Repositories
**Paths**: `tools/backdoored-test-repo/`, `tools/backdoored-test-repo-2/`

Intentionally vulnerable test repositories containing various security issues for testing security tools and demonstrating attack vectors. These repositories contain examples of:

- Git configuration vulnerabilities
- Exposed secrets and credentials
- Docker security misconfigurations
- VS Code malicious tasks and settings
- Supply chain attack vectors (lockfile tampering, typosquatting)
- Smart contract security issues (FFI usage, dangerous configurations)

**Note**: These are intentionally insecure repositories for testing purposes only.

## Getting Started

Each tool has its own README with detailed installation and usage instructions. Most tools are designed to run independently with minimal setup.

### General Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Git
- Basic command-line familiarity

### Installation Patterns
Most tools follow these patterns:
- **uv** (recommended): `uv run python script.py`
- **Just**: `just run` (where available)
- **Direct**: `python script.py`
- **Docker**: Available for some tools
