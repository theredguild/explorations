## DevSec Audit: Security Scanner for Development Environments
A comprehensive security auditing tool inspired by Lynis, specifically designed for development environments. DevSec Audit scans projects for security misconfigurations, dangerous settings, exposed secrets, and potential attack vectors across multiple technologies.

### Features
- **Git Security**: Scans Git configurations, hooks, aliases, SSH keys, and detects dangerous settings
- **Docker Security**: Analyzes Dockerfiles, docker-compose files, and DevContainer configurations for security issues
- **VS Code Security**: Reviews VS Code settings, extensions, tasks, and workspace configurations for vulnerabilities
- **Secrets Detection**: Identifies exposed sensitive files and checks if they're properly excluded from version control
- **Foundry Security**: Detects FFI usage and dangerous configurations in Foundry/Forge projects
- **Lockfile Analysis**: Checks package lock files for signs of tampering and typosquatting attacks

### Quick Start
```bash
# Navigate to the tool directory
cd tools/devsec-audit

# Run a quick scan of current directory
just run --target . --quick

# Scan specific modules
just run --target /path/to/project --modules git,docker,secrets

# Generate HTML report
just run --target . --format html --output security-report.html
```

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Security Scan
```bash
# Scan current directory with all modules
just run --target .

# Quick scan (essential checks only)
just run --target . --quick

# Scan with specific severity level
just run --target . --severity high
```

#### Module-Specific Scans
```bash
# Git security only
just run --target . --modules git

# Multiple modules
just run --target . --modules git,docker,vscode

# Check what can be scanned in a directory
just info --target /path/to/project
```

#### Report Generation
```bash
# HTML report
just run --target . --format html --output report.html

# JSON report for automation
just run --target . --format json --output results.json

# Text report to file
just run --target . --format text --output scan-results.txt
```

### Configuration
Create a `config.yaml` file to customize scanning behavior:

```yaml
# Modules to scan
modules:
  - git
  - docker
  - vscode
  - secrets
  - foundry

# Severity levels to report
severity_filter:
  - critical
  - high
  - medium

# Exclude paths (reduce false positives)
exclude_paths:
  - "**/node_modules/**"
  - "**/vendor/**"
  - "**/openzeppelin-contracts/**"

# Exclude specific files
exclude_files:
  - "*.test.json"
  - "*.fixture.json"
```

### Security Checks Performed

#### Git Security Module
- Dangerous Git aliases and hooks
- Credential helpers and SSH key permissions
- Git configuration vulnerabilities
- Submodule security issues
- Commit identity spoofing detection

#### Docker Security Module
- Dockerfile best practices
- Privileged containers and dangerous capabilities
- Insecure volume mounts
- DevContainer security configurations
- Missing .dockerignore files

#### VS Code Security Module
- Dangerous settings and auto-execution
- Suspicious extension recommendations
- Terminal and Python interpreter configurations
- Task security and command injection patterns
- Workspace trust settings

#### Secrets Scanner Module
- Exposed environment files and configuration files
- Private keys and certificates
- Database files and credentials
- Missing or incomplete .gitignore patterns
- Cloud provider credential files

#### Foundry Security Module
- FFI (Foreign Function Interface) usage in tests
- Dangerous filesystem permissions
- Foundry.toml security configurations
- Command execution in test files

### Installation Requirements
```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv sync

# Or using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Understanding Results
The tool provides a security score (0-100) and categorizes findings by severity:
- üî¥ **Critical**: Immediate security risks requiring urgent action
- üü† **High**: Significant security issues that should be addressed soon
- üü° **Medium**: Moderate security concerns worth reviewing
- üü¢ **Low**: Minor issues or hardening opportunities
- üîµ **Info**: Informational findings for awareness

### Integration with CI/CD
DevSec Audit returns appropriate exit codes for automation:
- `0`: Success (no critical/high issues)
- `1`: High severity issues found
- `2`: Critical security issues found

Example GitHub Actions integration:
```yaml
- name: Security Audit
  run: |
    cd tools/devsec-audit
    just run --target . --format json --output security-results.json
    # Upload results as artifact or fail build on critical issues
```


## VSExInspector.py: VSCode Extension Marketplace Inspector
Updating our devcontainer, I found a few suspicious VSCode extensions. We have already talked about this in the past, how easy it is to publish one and trick rating/downloads, and other details. So as a direct consequence of malicious extensions being deployed, tricking users into downloading them only to get rekt, we created a tool to start exploring how to monitor and filter extensions to request additional information and download to further analysis.

Current examples may be incomplete and are just examples; it does not mean they are malicious extensions.

TODO:

- [ ] Use GitHub Fake Analyzer or something of the sort to dig some info from repository
- [ ] Improve search filters

```
‚ùØ python vscode/VSExInspector.py --help

                        [--discord] [--discord-hook DISCORD_HOOK]

Fetch and display VSCode extensions from the Marketplace.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --keywords KEYWORDS   Comma-separated keywords to search for extensions.
  --tags TAGS           Semicolon-separated tags to filter for extensions, e.g.
                        'tag1;tag2'
  --date-type DATE_TYPE
                        releaseDate, publishedDate or lastUpdated
  --range-days RANGE_DAYS
                        Number of days to filter extensions by date.
  --download            Download and unzip VSIX files for matched extensions.
  --download-only DOWNLOAD_ONLY

  --analyze             Analyze extensions for suspicious characteristics.
  --info                Display additional informational fields for extensions.
  --info-only INFO_ONLY
                        Fetch and display full information for a specific
                        publisher.extension.
  --monitor             Run in daemon mode, checking updates every X minutes.
  --every EVERY         Interval in minutes for the monitor (default: 5).
  --discord             Send monitor messages to Discord (default off).
  --discord-hook DISCORD_HOOK
                        Set a custom Discord webhook. Otherwise uses DISCORD_WEBHOOK
                        from environment variable or code default.
```

### Example: Info & analyze, 30 days, few keywords.
Let's say we want to gather information and do an analysis on the past 30 days with a few keywords like solidity, ethereum and blockchain.

- From the past 30 days: `--range-days 30` 
- Keywords: `--keywords "solidity, ethereum, blockchain`
- Date type by release date: `--date-type releaseDate```
- Print information: `--info`
- Analyze: `--analyze`

```

### Example: Monitor & push to discord
Now, attackers may push a seemly legit repository, to be updated later with malicious content. So let's filter by lastUpdated and monitor it every 30' filtering by solidity, blockchain and ethereum tags.

There are several ways to include your webhook, you can add it exporting `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` as an env variable, or by using `--discord-hook [INSERT_YOUR_WEBHOOK_HERE]`

```
‚ùØ DISCORD_WEBHOOK=[INSERT_YOUR_WEBHOOK_HERE] python vscode/VSExInspector.py --range-days 10 --date-type lastUpdated --monitor --every 30 --tags "solidity;blockchain;ethereum" --discord
